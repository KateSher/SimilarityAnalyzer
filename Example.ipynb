erwin schrödinger in it illustrates what he saw as the problem of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects the thought experiment presents cat that might be alive or dead depending on an earlier random event in the course of developing this experiment he coined the term verschränkung entanglement literature this artwork by gwynplaine macintyre originally published in analog magazine illustrates macintyre science fiction story schrödinger cat sitter the cat occupies quantum superposition relative to the tined object being simultaneously in front of and behind the object which itself occupies quantum superposition because it is simultaneously square edged object with two tines and round edged object with three tines it was not long before science fiction writers picked up this evocative concept often using it in humorous vein several have taken the thought experiment step further pointing out extra complications that could arise should the experiment actually be performed for example in his novel american gods neil gaiman has character observe if they don ever open the box to feed it it ll eventually just be two different kinds of dead likewise terry pratchett lords and ladies adds the issue of third possible state in the case of greebo bloody furious in pratchett novel the last hero death attempts the experiment himself but cannot understand the mechanics of it wondering if it implies that he will kill the cat just by looking at it in will grayson will grayson by john green and david levithan the cat makes an appearance as an analogy for will and jane relationship robert anton wilson wrote trilogy of novels dealing with themes related to quantum mechanics collectively known as the schrödinger cat trilogy douglas adams describes an attempt to enact the experiment in his novel dirk gently holistic detective agency by using clairvoyance to see inside the box it was found that the cat was neither alive nor dead but missing and dirk services were employed to recover it dirk deducing that the cat had simply grown tired of being subjected to the experiment and wandered off although he admits later that he was using the experiment as an attempt to determine the mental state of his friend richard macduff richard logical arguments about why the experiment was pointless confirmed that he was mentally stable in libba bray book going bovine three stoners argue whether the cat is alive or dead or whether the person who opens the box creates the possibilities there are constant references to band called copenhagen

and the cat came back etc it is also popular children song theme the song is humorous in nature telling silly tale about ole mister johnson who had an ole yaller cat that he did not want and which kept coming back when he tried to get rid of it but the cat came back he couldn stay no long er yes the cat came back de very next day the cat came back thought she were goner but the cat came back for it wouldn stay away in miller original the cat finally died when an organ grinder came around one day and de cat look around awhile an kinder raised her head when he played ta rah dah boom da rah an de cat dropped dead even then the cat ghost came back the first commercial recording of the song was ca for the columbia phonograph company washington performed by charles marsh the cat came back was later recorded by fiddlin john carson okeh catalog in april other early recordings include one by dock philipine fiddlin doc roberts and the cat came back the very next day gennett on november the original sheet music described the song as comic negro absurdity on the back page and provided an additional eight verses as well as final chorus london edition of the sheet music described it as nigger absurdity on the cover sheet timing of the song the song is often used to teach children the concepts of rhythm and tempo it is an excellent example in this regard especially the minor key versions of the song because of the strong and consistent beat pattern combined with amusing and humorous lyrics like many children songs the song has strong well defined beat pattern it consists of one weak beat one strong beat so it is often sung in time thus it can be and often is sung while walking with for example strong beats when the left foot hits the ground and weak beats when the right foot hits the ground versions of the song there are many versions of the song in one the cat is yellow one version goes something like first verse now old mr john son had some trou bles of his own he had scarlet cat that just woul dn leave his home he tried and he tried to give the cat way he gave it to man going far far way chorus but the cat came back the very next day the cat came back we thought he was goner the cat came back he just wouldn stay way alternative chorus but the cat came back he wouldn stay away he was sitt ing on the porch the very next day every second beat is emphasized emphasized beats are shown underlined in bold each line of text in the above has eight beats and usually the chords fall piano or begin organ on the capitalized words the chord progression repeats every beats so one might think of the song as being in either time or time whichever denominator is used for reference time or time if the beat is quarter note etc the pattern of and is similar to the beat pattern in twinkle twinkle little star but phase shifted by degrees since the song starts on weak beat rather than the strong beat beginning of twinkle twinkle later version of the song emerged during the cold war in which the final verse made references to the atom bomb and bomb and the subsequent destruction of the human race key many versions are in major key but there are some versions in minor key the chord progression for many of the minor key versions is em variations in the melody of the additional verses the additional verses often have notable variation in melody but with the same chords for example the second verse often shoots up an octave to emphasize the words dynamite and found each sung an octave above the first note of the song which is if the song is
